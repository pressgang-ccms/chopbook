== What is it? ==

Chopbook is a tool for uploading Publican books to Pressgang CCMS.

== How do I install it? ==

Before using it, follow these instructions:

1. Install the following RPMs:

    $ sudo yum -y install python python-lxml python-progressbar python-httplib2 python-urllib3

In the future, I'll be packaging it with these RPMs as dependencies. For the moment, install the packages with yum.

2. Clone the chopbook git repo:

    $ git clone git://git.engineering.redhat.com/users/dmacpher/chopbook.git/.git
    $ cd chopbook

3. Install the chopbook script by placing it in a bin directory within your home directory (i.e. ~/bin):

    $ mkdir ~/bin
    $ cp src/chopbook ~/bin/.

Also, if the chopbook script is not executable, change the permissions:

    $ chmod +x ~/bin/chopbook

3. Include and export ~/bin as part of your $PATH environment variable in your .bash_profile (or .bashrc) file.

    $ vi ~/.bash_profile (or vi~/.bashrc

Paste the following:

    PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
    export PATH

Save this file. Also export the PATH from the command line:

    $ export PATH

You can now use the script from anywhere.

4. Run the script with the -h option for instructions:

    $ chopbook -h

== How do I update it? ==

1. Make sure the following RPMs are installed:

    $ sudo yum -y install python python-lxml python-progressbar python-httplib2 python-urllib3

2. Go to your chopbook git repo and run the following command:

    $ git pull

3. Copy the new file to your ~/bin directory

    $ cp src/chopbook ~/bin/.

Also, if the chopbook script is not executable, change the permissions:

    $ chmod +x ~/bin/chopbook

== Notes ==

Use the --test-sever option to migrate the book to the Pressgang dev server (skynet-dev.usersys.redhat.com) instead of the main Pressgang CCMS server (skynet.usersys.redhat.com). I recommend using this method to test your book first before importing to Pressgang. If it succeeds with --test-server, then it should succeed with the real Pressgang server.

I've tested on the following books so far:

- OpenShift Enterprise 2.0 Administration Guide (No errors)
- OpenShift Enterprise 2.0 Client Tools Installation Guide (No errors)
- Red Hat Satellite 5.6 Installation Guide (No errors)
- Red Hat Satellite 5.6 Getting Started Guide (No errors)
- Red hat Enterprise Linux 7 Installation Guide (4 errors)

Other things to note:
* No support for importing Entities into the content spec yet - Coming soon! (Currently, entities are converted to fixed values, which sucks!)
* Docbook 5 support needs testing
